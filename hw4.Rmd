average students height.
Confidence interval for a mean
```{r}

```

(b) What is the highest average height you expect a stu-
dent to have, based on the confidence interval from
(a)?
(c) Using R, find the 99% confidence interval for the
average students pulse.
(d) What is the lowest average pulse you expect a stu-
dent to have, based on the confidence interval from
(c)?
