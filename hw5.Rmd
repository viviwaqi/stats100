A treatment class of 21
third-grade students participated in these activities for
eight weeks, and a control class of 23 third-graders fol-
lowed the same curriculum without the activities. After
the eight-week period, students in both classes took a
Degree of Reading Power (DRP) test which measures
the aspects of reading ability that the treatment is de-
signed to improve.
The first column is the group (treatment or control), and
the second is the DRP score (the higher the better).

(a) Find the 95% confidence interval for the difference
in average DRP score.

```{r}
controlt<- drp %>%
  filter(Treatment == "Control") %>%
  summarise(Treatment, Response)
controlt
```
```{r}
treatedt<- drp %>%
  filter(Treatment == "Treated") %>%
  summarise(Treatment, Response)
treatedt
```

```{r}
t.test(controlt$Response, treatedt$Response, conf.level = 0.95)
```
Answer: (-18.67588, -1.23302)

(b) If the experimenter is interested in if the treatment
group has a higher average than the control group,
find the test-statistic.

```{r}
t.test(controlt$Response, treatedt$Response, alternative = "less")
```
Answer: -2.3109

(c) If the experimenter is interested in if the treatment
group has a higher average than the control group,
find the p-value.

Answer: 0.01319

(d) Do we fail to reject or reject the null hypothesis if
a = 0.05?

Answer: 0.01319<0.05 so p<a and we can reject null

IQ.csv has two
columns, the first of which denotes what major a stu-
dent is from (A, B, or C). The second is the IQ measured
by the Stanfordâ€“Binet Intelligence Scales. The goal is to
determine if this IQ measures differs on average between
majors.

```{r}
iqdf<- read_csv("IQ.csv")
iqdf
```
```{r}
iqmodel<- lm(iqdf$iq~iqdf$group)
iqmodel
```
```{r}
anova(iqmodel)
```

(a) Find the value of the F test-statistic.
Answer: F stat= 20.016

(b) Find the p-value of the test.
Answer: P-value= Pr(>F)=7.843e-07

c) Do we fail to reject or reject the null hypothesis?
(Choose your own a)
Answer: If a=0.001 then p-value is less than that it, and p<a so we can reject the null

(d) State your conclusion in terms of the problem.
Answer: Rejection of null means that average IQ does not vary by major
