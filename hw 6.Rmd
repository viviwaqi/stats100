```{r}
iqq<- read.csv("IQ.csv")
iqq
```
On Canvas under Files you will find a dataset IQ.csv. It
has two columns, the first of which denotes what major
a student is from (A, B, or C). The second is the IQ
measured by the Stanfordâ€“Binet Intelligence Scales. The
goal is to determine if this IQ measure differs between
majors.
(a) Calculate the family-wise (simultaneous, Bonfer-
roni) 95% confidence intervals for (muA-muB), (muA-
muC), and (muB -muC), assuming you will make k = 3
total confidence intervals.
```{r}
summary(iqq)
```

```{r}
qt(1-0.05/(2*3), 45-3)
```
```{r}
Ybar = aggregate(iq ~ group, data = iqq, mean)$iq
ni = aggregate(iq ~ group, data = iqq, length)$iq
```

```{r}
the.model = lm(iq ~ group, data = iqq)
ANOVA.table = anova(the.model)
mse = ANOVA.table[2,3] #ms(within)
```

```{r}
alpha = 0.05
I = 3 # number of groups 
k = choose(I, 2)
n. = sum(ni) #total sample size

t_ag = qt(1- alpha/(2*k), df = n. - k) #t percentile
```
```{r}
# 4. Construct the bonferroni CIs

BON12 = c(Ybar[1] - Ybar[2] - t_ag*sqrt(mse*(1/ni[1] + 1/ni[2])), 
          Ybar[1] - Ybar[2] + t_ag*sqrt(mse*(1/ni[1] + 1/ni[2])))
BON13 = c(Ybar[1] - Ybar[3] - t_ag*sqrt(mse*(1/ni[1] + 1/ni[3])), 
          Ybar[1] - Ybar[3] + t_ag*sqrt(mse*(1/ni[1] + 1/ni[3])))
BON23 = c(Ybar[2] - Ybar[3] - t_ag*sqrt(mse*(1/ni[2] + 1/ni[3])), 
          Ybar[2] - Ybar[3] + t_ag*sqrt(mse*(1/ni[2] + 1/ni[3])))
```
```{r}
# 5. We could calculate the two side p-value
pvalue12 = 2*pt(abs(Ybar[1] - Ybar[2])/sqrt(mse*(1/ni[1] + 1/ni[2])), df = n.-k, lower.tail = F)
pvalue13 = 2*pt(abs(Ybar[1] - Ybar[3])/sqrt(mse*(1/ni[1] + 1/ni[3])), df = n.-k, lower.tail = F)
pvalue23 = 2*pt(abs(Ybar[2] - Ybar[3])/sqrt(mse*(1/ni[2] + 1/ni[3])), df = n.-k, lower.tail = F)
allpvalues = c(pvalue12, pvalue13, pvalue23)
```

```{r}
BON_all = rbind(BON12, BON13, BON23)
all.result = cbind(BON_all, allpvalues)
rownames(all.result) = c("A vs. B", "A vs. C", "B vs. C")
colnames(all.result) = c("Lower", "Upper", "P-value")
knitr::kable(all.result)
```


(b) What is the largest significant difference in averages
suggested by all of the confidence intervals? (This
should be one number).
A vs. C 
```{r}
18.028046-6.771954
```


(c) What is the smallest significant difference in aver-
ages suggested by all of the confidence intervals?
(This should be one number).
B vs. C
```{r}
17.961379-6.705288	
```


(d) What two majors were the most significantly differ-
ent according to the confidence intervals?
A and B

```{r}
beanz<- read.csv("beans.csv")
beanz
```
(a) Find the test statistic.

```{r}
beantable<- table(beanz)
beantable
```

```{r}
beantest<- chisq.test(beantable, correct = F)
beantest
```
Answer = 8.1796
(b) Find the p-value.
Answer = 0.04244

(c) Did you reject or fail to reject the null if alpha = 0.05?
Answer p<a so we can reject

(d) Which bean plant(s) did the weevils prefer more
than expected if the null was true?
```{r}
beantable-beantest$expected
```
Answer = Northern
(e) What category contributed most to the value of the
test-statistic?
```{r}
beantest$residuals^2
```
Answer = Northern
#3
```{r}
blood<- read_csv("blood.csv")
blood
```

(a) State the appropriate null for testing if having this
particular disease is independent of blood type and
alternative hypothesis for testing if having this par-
ticular disease is independent of blood type.

Null:Disease is not independent from blood type
Alt: Disease is independent from blood type

(b) Find the test-statistic.
```{r}
bloodtable<- table(blood$Type, blood$Disease)
bloodtable
```
```{r}
bloodtest<- chisq.test(bloodtable, correct = F)
bloodtest
```
Answer = 10.654
(c) Find the p-value.
Answer = 0.01375

(d) State your conclusion in terms of the problem, as-
suming alpha = 0.01.

p>a so we cannot reject. We cannot say for sure that they are independent

(e) Were blood type A individuals more or less likely to
have the disease than what we expected if the null
was true?
```{r}
bloodtest$observed - bloodtest$expected
```
Answer = Less likely

(f) Were blood type O individuals more or less likely to
have the disease than what we expected if the null
was true?

Answer = More likely

(g) Which group contributed most to the value of the
test-statistic?
```{r}
bloodtest$residuals^2
```

Answer = AB
